### note :
    . remember the suffixes when initializing floating varibles , otherwise the default will be double .
        - what that mean when float var {1.552f} must be f in the end .
        - in long double case must be L in end .
        - in double no need the compiler by default read it as double .
    . double works well in many situations , so you will see it used a lot .
