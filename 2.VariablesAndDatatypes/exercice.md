Great â€” since you already know programming and JavaScript, Iâ€™ll give you **C++ practice exercises** focused on **variables and data types**, but with a slight challenge to match your experience level. These will help you get comfortable with **syntax, types, and memory concepts in C++** before diving deeper into DSA.

## ðŸ§  **C++ Practice Exercises â€“ Variables & Data Types**

### âœ… 1. **Swap Two Variables (using a third variable)**

Write a program that swaps the values of two integers using a temporary variable.

**Example:**

```txt
Input: a = 5, b = 10
Output: a = 10, b = 5
```

---

### âœ… 2. **Swap Without Temporary Variable**

Same as above, but **without using any extra variable**.

Hint: Use arithmetic: `a = a + b`, etc.

---

### âœ… 3. **Character ASCII Value**

Ask the user for a character and print its ASCII value.

**Example:**

```txt
Input: A
Output: 65
```

---

### âœ… 4. **Simple Calculator**

Ask for two numbers and a character operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`), and perform the operation.

**Example:**

```txt
Input: 10 + 5
Output: 15
```

---

### âœ… 5. **Boolean Logic**

Create two `bool` variables and apply:

* AND `&&`
* OR `||`
* NOT `!`

Print the results.

---

### âœ… 6. **Type Conversion Check**

```cpp
double d = 5.7;
int i = d;
```

Print both values. Try converting string to int with `stoi`.

---

### âœ… 7. **Get User Name and Age**

Ask the user to input:

* A full name (with spaces)
* Age

Then print:

```txt
Hello [name], you are [age] years old.
```

> ðŸ’¡ Hint: Use `getline(cin, name)` for string input with spaces.

---

### âœ… 8. **String Reversal (manual)**

Write a program that reverses a string **without using `reverse()`**.

---

### âœ… 9. **Vector Basics**

* Create a vector of integers
* Add 5 numbers using `push_back()`
* Print them using a loop
* Print the size using `.size()`

---

### âœ… 10. **Vector Sum**

Input a vector of `n` numbers, and calculate the sum.

---

### âœ… 11. **Vector: Find Max Element**

Ask for numbers, store in vector, and find the **maximum** number manually (without `max_element()`).

---

### âœ… 12. **Count Characters in a String**

Count how many vowels (a, e, i, o, u) appear in a given string.

---

### âœ… 13. **Is Palindrome (string)**

Check if a string is a palindrome (same forward and backward).
