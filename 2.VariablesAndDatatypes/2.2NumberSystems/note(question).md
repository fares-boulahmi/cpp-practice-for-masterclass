## search for how 0 1 convene to what human can read like int char etc

## search for decimal number and binary number search for next :

- in decimal we split to 10^2 like operation
  - like : 2371 = 2-10^3 + 3*10^2 + 7*10^1 + 1\*10^0
  - 924 = 9*10^2 + 2*10^1 + 4\*10^0
- but in binary transform to 2Â¨x in math not logic have to be deep search :
  - like : 100101 = 1*2^5 + 0*2^4 + 1*2^2 + 0*2^1 + 1\*2^0 = 37
  - 10010 = 1*2^4 + 0*2^3 + 0*2^2 + 1*2^1 + 0\*2^0 = 22

### in operation i know how to do it but not why 2^x what the deep and logic behind it 37 = 100101 and 10010 = 22 to binary to decimal is true but why this rule of 2^x and refresh the transform from dec to binary

## the 3 digits in memory ( really need deep understand )

## understand of grouping bits 3 bits 4 bits of data in memory because really don't understand a shit from why , what understand is when store easy number in memory will store in bits like 1 can store in 001 0001 00001 but why grouping and when grouping like 1 is one bit 1 every group have limit 3 limit is 7 , 4 limit is 15 , 5 limit is 31 : the limit of n is 0~2^n - 1

# understand the hexadecimal what is these number what is mean to programming world

- is work from 10 end to 15 group in 4 bits group but really what is that
- understand to make 6A5B6C but has limit to 15 what the use of it i catch only that need to type group of bits but can understand lets say want 1 1 11 2 10 be 11B2A
- but that what my understand stop
- using 0x to present that hexadecimal number 0x 11B2A
- padding number is when grouping 4 bits groups but one is missing bits fill the miss with 0 bits lets say 1 will be 0001 that call padding
  - the group start from last bits not first mean the group will fill for first bit

#### octal system is not much used today take a lock on it be like hexadecimal like 0 then the number but start from 0 to 7 and group the bits in 3 ( why used i don't know )

## search why is this used in c++ program what the benefit of it

#### for binary in c++ use 0b like 0x in hex and 0 in oct the 0b was invite to c++ from version c++14

## in main in identical number function will you see number 15 declaire with four way decimal octal hexadecimal binary and all return same number with different way of type the value why need to understand that is will be convenient in what we use is really used in real case depend on what we need but the representation of these number will be the same search deeply in that => in real career if dev will see that a lot
